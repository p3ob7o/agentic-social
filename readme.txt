A WordPress plugin to help publishers post their content to LinkedIn and other platforms in a semi-automated manner that aligns with social platform algorithms.

== Description ==

Agentic Social Sharing is a WordPress plugin designed to help publishers share their content on social media platforms, particularly LinkedIn, in a way that aligns with platform algorithms and best practices.

= Key Features =

* **Semi-automated sharing**: Balance automation with manual control for optimal engagement
* **Algorithm-friendly**: Posts links as comments instead of in the main post body
* **AI Agent Mode**: Designed to work with AI agentic browsers like Perplexity's Comet
* **LinkedIn Integration**: Seamless sharing to LinkedIn with customizable messages
* **Share History**: Track all your social media shares from one dashboard
* **Post-level Control**: Choose which posts to share and customize messages per post
* **Delayed Sharing**: Set delays to avoid appearing spammy
* **Multiple Post Types**: Support for posts, pages, and custom post types

= Why Agentic Social Sharing? =

Social media platforms increasingly favor authentic, manual posting over API-based automation. This plugin bridges the gap by providing a semi-automated approach that:

1. Respects platform algorithms by avoiding pure API posting
2. Adds links as comments (better engagement rates)
3. Allows for manual review and customization
4. Can be fully automated using AI browser agents

= AI Agent Compatibility =

The plugin is specifically designed to work with AI agentic browsers, making it possible to achieve full automation while maintaining the appearance of manual posting.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `agentic-social` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to 'Agentic Social' in your WordPress admin menu to configure settings
4. Configure your LinkedIn settings (and other platforms as they become available)
5. Start sharing your content!

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 5.8 or greater
* PHP version 7.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.6 or greater

= Recommended Requirements =

* WordPress 6.4 or greater
* PHP version 8.0 or greater
* MySQL version 8.0 or greater

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin use the official LinkedIn API? =

The plugin is designed to work in a semi-automated manner that can be handled by AI agentic browsers, avoiding direct API posting when configured in AI Agent Mode.

= Can I customize the message for each post? =

Yes! Each post has a meta box where you can write a custom message for that specific share.

= Does it support other social media platforms? =

Currently, the plugin focuses on LinkedIn, but the architecture is designed to support additional platforms in future updates.

= How does the "Add Link as Comment" feature work? =

Instead of including the post URL in the main social media post (which can reduce reach), the plugin can add it as the first comment, which typically results in better engagement.

= What is AI Agent Mode? =

AI Agent Mode optimizes the plugin's interface and workflow for interaction with AI agentic browsers like Perplexity's Comet, enabling fully automated posting that appears manual.

= Can I schedule posts for specific times? =

The current version supports delay-based sharing. Specific time scheduling is planned for a future update.
